Dockerized WordPress 5 (PHP-FPM 7.4), with Nginx on Alpine Linux
 
### What is this ?

A docker-compose deployment of a single site WordPress instance using MariaDB as backing database with Redis for object caching & Nginx as the application server; based on Alpine Linux.

### Why Alpine Linux ?

Small. Simple. Secure.

Alpine Linux is a security-oriented, lightweight Linux distribution based on musl libc and busybox. It compiles all user-space binaries as position-independent executables with stack-smashing protection.

Because of its small size, it is commonly used in containers providing quick boot-up times.

### Why Docker ? 

Developing apps today requires so much more than writing code. Multiple languages, frameworks, architectures, and discontinuous interfaces between tools for each lifecycle stage creates enormous complexity. 

Docker simplifies and accelerates workflow, while giving developers the freedom to innovate with their choice of tools, application stacks, and deployment environments for each project.

### Why Docker-Compose ?

Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. With Compose, you use a Compose file to configure your application's services. Then, using a single command, you create and start all the services from your configuration.

### Why Nginx ?

The goal behind NGINX was to create the fastest web server around, and maintaining that excellence is still a central goal of the project. NGINX consistently beats Apache and other servers in benchmarks measuring web server performance. 

Since the original release of NGINX however, websites have expanded from simple HTML pages to dynamic, multifaceted content. NGINX has grown along with it and now supports all the components of the modern Web, including WebSocket, HTTP/2, and streaming of multiple video formats (HDS, HLS, RTMP, and others).
